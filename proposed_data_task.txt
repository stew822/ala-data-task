# ALA Data Analyst position

# task
Produce an informative visualisation based on the attached dataset, and accompanying
code showing the steps required to explore the data and produce the diagram.

There is no need to visualise every possible aspect of the 
dataset (though you can try to do that if you'd like). Instead, seek to
effectively highlight an aspect of the dataset that you think is particularly 
interesting or valuable.

The task is intended to take no longer than two hours.

# data
The data provided are taken from the ALA, and give 6,911 occurrence records for 
reptiles recorded in the Australian Capital Territory. The columns are as follows:

- recordID | unique identifier for this record, used by the ALA
- decimalLatitude | latitude
- decimalLongitude | longitude
- eventDate | date of observation or collection
- family | taxonomic family this species occurs in
- scientificName | the species scientific name
- taxonConceptID | unique identifier for this taxon, used by the ALA
- dataResourceName | which institution provided the data
- basisOfRecord | what 'type' of record this is
- recordedBy | name of observer
- ABS_SA2_region_2016 | the statistical area (SA2) this record occurs in

# format
You should generate a new GitHub (or similar) repository containing:

1. a script showing the analytical steps taken to produce the visualisation,
   including exploratory steps to investigate the data; and,
2. the visualisation itself

You should also take care to document your process carefully, using any combination
of:

- informative commit messages
- commented code
- a well-constructed README file
- any other steps you consider important for others to interpret your code

You can provide your visualisation in any format that you think would be most 
informative, though there are extra 'points' for clarity, aesthetics, and effective 
use of dynamic elements. Whatever output you choose, the result should be presented 
clearly, with sufficient information that the reader can readily interpret the 
content provided.
